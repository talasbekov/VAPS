# Graphify-first workflow

Every new chat MUST read the graphify output before proceeding:
- graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md
- graphify-out/graph.json

Before reading the graph, you are FORBIDDEN to:
- randomly open files
- do broad grep/rg/find
- scan the entire project
- start implementing the task

You must use Graphify to find relationships:
- graphify query "<question>"
- graphify path "<source>" "<target>"
- graphify explain "<node>"

Also:
- Do NOT touch application source code unless instructed.
- Do NOT change business-logic.
- Do NOT change tests.
- Do NOT change migrations.
- Do NOT add graphify-out/ to .gitignore (except its cache/).
- `graphify-out/` must remain available for future Jules sessions.
